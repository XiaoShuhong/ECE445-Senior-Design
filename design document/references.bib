% For online sources, can follow the following example.
% Note that wrapping text with an extra {} makes it verbatim in the reference output.
% For example, titles are normally in sentence-casing no matter what you put in here, but if you add {{IEEE Code of Ethics}} instead of {IEEE Code of Ethics} it comes out as "IEEE Code of Ethics" instead of Ieee Code of Ethics.
