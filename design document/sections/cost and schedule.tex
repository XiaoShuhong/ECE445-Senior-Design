\subsection{Cost Analysis}
Graduated from UIUC, the average salary of an CompE student is \$99,145/year\cite{salary} and for ME student, the average salary is \$79,117/year\cite{salary-me}. With average person works 2080 hours/year. For our team, equipped with two CompE students and one ME students, we will have a salary of $\$99,145/2080\times2+\$79,117/2080=\$133.37/hour$ in total. Except the very early weeks for brainstorming, we assume 10 weeks of working time, with 10 hours working time for each person each week, we have a total labor cost: $$3\times\$133.37/hours\times10 weeks\times10 hours/week=\$40,010$$
Our parts costs are listed below, \$4.08 for each.

\end{table}  


We plan to produce 3 coat hanger for demo, so the final total cost is $$\$40,010+3\times\$4.08=\$400,22.24$$
